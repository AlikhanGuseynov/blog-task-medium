    "content": "With the sunset of Python 2, Java 8, PHP 5, and Go 1.11, by their respective communities, Google Cloud has assured users by expressing continued long-term support of these legacy App Engine runtimes, including maintaining the Python 2 runtime.

    "content": "In front of a standing-room-only lunch panel, Minu Puranik asks us, “If there is one thing you want to change [about Bazel’s DEI culture], what would it be and why?” We’d spent the last hour on three main themes: community culture, fostering trust, and growing our next generation of leaders. Moderated by Minu, the Strategy and Operations leader for DeveloperX & DevRel at Google, our panel brought together a slate of brilliant people from underrepresented genders and populations of color to give a platform to our experiences and ideas. Together with representatives and allies in the community, we explored methods to building inclusivity in our open source community and sought a better understanding of the institutional and systemic barriers to increasing diversity.",
